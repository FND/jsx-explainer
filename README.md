Getting Started

* ensure [Node](http://nodejs.org) is installed
* `npm install` downloads dependencies
* `npm run compile` performs a one-time compilation, generating `dist/bundle.js`
* `npm start` automatically recompiles while monitoring code changes
* `npm test` checks code for stylistic consistency
* open `index.html` to see the results
